          <h2 class="ab">My journey to yoga</h2>
          
          <p class="abp">During the lockdown period I tried my hands on different things. I learnt some new skills on coursera but excitement goes to 0 after some days. 
              Then I started watching tv series. They ended soon. I helped my mother and tried to make different things but soon I was tired. Then I learned how to make different dresses from my mother. I made one top and one gown. I tried a lot of things, But I ended up with yoga. One day I was just scrolling my phone. 
              I found some yoga poses, I tried them the next morning and I enjoyed them. Then I started practising different yoga. 
              Sometimes I do meditation in the morning and the feeling is just awesome. I tried handstand, headstand, split and a lot more .
               From that day onwards I practised yoga daily to refresh myself. And truly said:
              <br>Yoga is the journey of the self, through the self, to the self - Bhagvad Gita</br>
