          <h2 class = "head2b">My journey to yoga</h2>
          <br></br>
          <p class = "p1b">During lockdown period i tried my hands on different things. Started with cooking
              food, making dresses, decorating walls ,etc. But i end up with yoga. One day i was just scrolling my phone i found some yoga poses, I tried them
              next morning and i enjoyed. Then i started practising different yoga. Sometime i do meditation at morning and the feeling is just awesome. I tried
              handstand, headstand, split but i failed. But i never left yoga and within 4-5 days i was able to do hand stand and all
              yoga i want to do. This is how journey begins. And truely said:
              <br>Yoga is the journey of the self, through the self, to the self - Bhagvad Gita</br>
