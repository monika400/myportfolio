      <h2>About</h2>
      <div id= "about">
      <p>Monika is a girl who can find happiness in every situation.She is final year undergraduate student and currently persuing Electrical engeenering
          from IIT Kanpur. She likes to code and intrested in implementation part of ML. She had done an internship with American Express
          as a Data Analyst. She had done some cool technical project.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Technical Projects</h2>
      <h3>Python Library for Data visualisation and Evaluation</h3>
      <p> Created a library that will provide all required visualisation chart for data. Created a library that will provide all required model evaluation metric </p>

      <h3>Statistical study of bug localization techniques</h3>
      <p>Ranked 25 metrics, which help in ranking the components of code based on bugginess. Used test-suites for ranking above 25 metrics by assuming flakiness in failing test cases. Compared the  metrics using p-values obtained from wilcoxon test and analysed them using visualisation. Analysed the ranking of metrics obtained with assuming flakiness and without flakiness in test suites</p>
      
      <h3>Haptic wristband</h3>
      <p>Fabricated wristbands that help us navigate to given destination using the Haptics nudge provided by bands. Bands were paired with a phone where an Android app processes data received from Google Maps and GPS. Arduino controlled bands containing Wifi module communicated with mobile via serial communication</p>
