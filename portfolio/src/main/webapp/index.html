        <h4>Project</h4>
        <h5>Python Library for Data visualisation and Evaluation</h5>
        <p> Created a library that will provide all required visualisation chart for data. Created a library that will provide all required model evaluation metric </p>

        <h5>Statistical study of bug localization techniques</h5>
        <p>Ranked 25 metrics, which help in ranking the components of code based on bugginess. Used test-suites for ranking above 25 metrics by assuming flakiness in failing test cases. Compared the  metrics using p-values obtained from wilcoxon test and analysed them using visualisation. Analysed the ranking of metrics obtained with assuming flakiness and without flakiness in test suites</p>
      
        <h5>Haptic wristband</h5>
        <p>Fabricated wristbands that help us navigate to given destination using the Haptics nudge provided by bands. Bands were paired with a phone where an Android app processes data received from Google Maps and GPS. Arduino controlled bands containing Wifi module communicated with mobile via serial communication</p>
