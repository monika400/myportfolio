      <h1>Project</h1>
      <h2>Python Library for Data visualisation and Evaluation</h2>
        <p> Created a library that will provide all required visualisation chart for data.</p> 
        <p>Created a library that will provide all required model evaluation metric </p>
 
        <h2>Statistical study of bug localization techniques</h2>
        <p>Ranked 25 metrics, which help in ranking the components of code based on bugginess.</p> 
        <p>Used test-suites for ranking above 25 metrics by assuming flakiness in failing test cases. Compared the  metrics using p-values obtained from wilcoxon test and analysed them using visualisation.</p>
        <p> Analysed the ranking of metrics obtained with assuming flakiness and without flakiness in test suites</p>
      
        <h2>Haptic wristband</h2>
        <p>Fabricated wristbands that help us navigate to given destination using the Haptics nudge provided by bands.</p>
        <p> Bands were paired with a phone where an Android app processes data received from Google Maps and GPS. Arduino controlled bands containing Wifi module communicated with mobile via serial communication</p>
