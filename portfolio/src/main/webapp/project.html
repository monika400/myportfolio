      <h2 class = "head2">Python Library for Data visualisation and Evaluation</h2>
        <p class = "p1"> Created a library that will provide all required visualisation chart for data. 
        <br>Created a library that will provide all required model evaluation metric </br></p>
 
        <h2 class = "head2">Statistical study of bug localization techniques</h2>
        <p class = "p1">Ranked 25 metrics, which help in ranking the components of code based on bugginess.<br> 
        Used test-suites for ranking above 25 metrics by assuming flakiness in failing test cases.</br> Compared the  metrics using p-values obtained from wilcoxon test and analysed them using visualisation.
         <br>Analysed the ranking of metrics obtained with assuming flakiness and without flakiness in test suites</br></p>
      
        <h2 class = "head2">Smart Note Taker</h2>
        <p class = "p1">Build a model that would recognise the human speech and summarise the content
        <br>Used a pre trained model that will record the audio and convert it into notes.</br></p>


        <h2 class = "head2">Spectral learning approach to Range only SLAM</h2>
        <p class = "p1">Presented a novel spectral learning algorithm for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
        <br>Formulated it as matrix problem, where features of observations are related to higher dimensional state space
        </br> Developed MATLAB code to estimate robot's trajectory and the location of landmarks.</p>
        <h2 class = "head2">Haptic wristband</h2>
        <p class = "p1">Fabricated wristbands that help us navigate to given destination using the Haptics nudge provided by bands.<br>
         Bands were paired with a phone where an Android app processes data received from Google Maps and GPS. Arduino controlled bands containing Wifi module communicated with mobile via serial communication</br></p>
